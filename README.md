## Magical Snakes and Ladders... and the drunk Wizard's!


#### Statement of Purpose and Scope

"Magical Snakes & Ladders... and the drunk Wizard's!" (MSAL) is a bash-terminal application which is a fun and silly twist on the classic turn based boardgame Snakes and Ladders. MSAL can be played by up to four people and will provide a realtime visual layout of the game, including a 'game-board'and individual player positions. The core rules of the game are the same, but MSAL has a few extra feautures and rules which will expand on the orignal to enhance the fun and enjoyment of the game for a more mature audience.

MSAL is being created as part of a personal project which requires the game to run as a bash-terminal application. Because of this requirement, there was an oppurtunity to enhance the core rules and functionality of the game, so in planning and brainstorming ideas for the application, the idea of a 'Wizard' as a potential encounter during gameplay seemed to be the perfect addition.

MSAL is being created as part of a personal project by the developer, but the main goal for the application is purely for entertainment, as it hopes to give the user/s an enjoyable moment of silliness and delight during gameplay.. that is all :)
